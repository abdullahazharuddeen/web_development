In blue and green peacocks, the male
   has a 90–130-cm (35–50-inch) 
body and 150-cm (60-inch) train of 
   tail feathers that are coloured a 
brilliant metallic green. This train
    is mainly formed of the bird’s upper
tail coverts, which are enormously elongated.
    Each feather is tipped with an iridescent
eyespot that is ringed with blue and bronze.
    In courtship displays, the cock 
elevates his tail, which lies under the 
    train, thus elevating the train and bringing
it forward. At the climax  of this display, 
    the tail feathers are vibrated, giving 
the feathers of the train a shimmering
    appearance and making a rustling sound.</pre></h3>

     Birds are vertebrate animals adapted for flight.
             
     Many can also run, jump, swim, and dive. Some, like penguins, have lost the 
         ability to fly but retained their wings. Birds are found worldwide and in all
     habitats. The largest is the nine-foot-tall ostrich. The smallest is the two-
         inch-long bee hummingbird.
         
             Everything about the anatomy of a bird reflects its ability to fly. The wings,
         for example, are shaped to create lift. The leading edge is thicker than the
             back edge, and they are covered in feathers that narrow to a point. Airplane 
                     wings are modeled after bird wings.
         
                     The bones and muscles of the wing are also highly specialized. The main
             bone, the humerus, which is similar to the upper arm of a mammal, is hollow
         instead of solid. It also connects to the bird’s air sac system, which, in turn, 
             connects to its lungs. The powerful flight muscles of the shoulder attach to
         the keel, a special ridge of bone that runs down the center of the wide
             sternum, or breastbone. The tail feathers are used for steering.
         
             Birds have a unique digestive system that allows them to eat when they can
         —usually on the fly—and digest later. They use their beaks to grab and
             swallow food. Even the way a bird reproduces is related to flight. Instead of 
         carrying the extra weight of developing young inside their bodies, they lay
             eggs and incubate them in a nest.
         
             The fossil record shows that birds evolved alongside the dinosaurs during
         the Jurassic period 160 million years ago. The best known fossil is
              archaeopteryx, which was about the size of a crow.
